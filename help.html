<h2 id="account-members">Account Members</h2>

<details open="true">
    <summary>title</summary>
    <p>Title string representing the user. It is displayed as the browser's page/tab title.</p>
</details>
<details open="true">
    <summary>accounts</summary>
    <p>Array of account objects. Each object in the array has the same structure as <code>default</code>,
        which is used to populate <code>undefined</code> members of each account structure, so, all members of each account are formally optional.
        For explanation of account object members, see <code>default</code> below.
        However, three members are practically essential in all cases:
    </p>
    <details>
        <summary>identity.seed</summary>
        <p>This field is critically important and should be unique. Combined with master password, it is used for generation of cryptographic hash.
            If an account password has to be changed, some part of <code>seed</code> should be modified, otherwise new password will be the same as old one,
            or made different only due to the changes in <code>selection</code>, which would be not safe enough.
            It's a good idea to include date or date/time of the new password creation in the <code>seed</code> string.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>display.name</summary>
        <p>This name is used for UI navigation using the list box on left.
            Besides, it is shown on top of the account table, which also can be used as an anchor, if <code>display.url</code>code> is defined.</code></p>

<details open="true">
    <summary>default</summary>

            <summary>seed</summary>
            <p>Seed string used for cryptographic hash generation. The hash is generated from a master password and

                <p>Character repertoire string used to represent part of generated cryptographic hash array in textual
                    form.
                    A password string will be composed from the characters taken from character repertoire and also
                    those

            <details>
                <summary>start</summary>
                <p>Starting index in the cryptographic hash array. This is an integer value which doesn't have to be
                    less

                <summary>shift</summary>
                <p>Integer representing shift in the character repertoire. This index doesn't have to be less then the

                <summary>inserts</summary>
                <p>Inserts member is used to work around the problem with the sites with some special password rules.
                    For example, some rules require the presense of at least one character of each of several character
                    sets.
                    To meed such criteria, some fixed character sequences can be <i>inserted</i> into the automatically
                    generated password string in different positions. This is an object with the structure shown below, or and array of such objects:</p>
                <details>
                    <summary>value</summary>

                    <summary>position</summary>
                    <p>Optional position of the text to be inserted in the password string. If this value exceeds the length of
                        current password string, the <code>value</code> is appended. If this value is negative, the
                        position is counted from the end of the current password string. If it is not defined, it is equivalent to position 0.</p>

            <p>Display name of the account, used in the navigation list box and in the header of the account table.</p>

        <details>
            <summary>url</summary>
            <p>URL of the site where authentication is required. Ideally, it should be a logon page or a page where
                logon is
                clearly visible. If URL is defined, the header of the account table becomes an anchor used to navigate
